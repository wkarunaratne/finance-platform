# Module 1: Budgeting and Consumption Basics

### Learning objectives

- Understand the Keynesian consumption function and the concept of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).
- Identify essential vs. discretionary expenses and construct a personal budget.
- Calculate and interpret average and marginal propensities to save.

### What is a budget?

A budget is a plan for your income and expenditures.  It helps you allocate your salary between essential consumption (housing, food, utilities) and discretionary spending (entertainment, travel) while setting aside money for saving and investment.

### The consumption function

In macroeconomics, the consumption function describes how consumption depends on disposable income:

\[ C = a + b\,Y_d \]

where *C* is total consumption, *Y_d* is disposable income, *a* is autonomous consumption (spending on necessities even with zero income) and *b* is the marginal propensity to consume (the fraction of additional income spent on consumption)【699025171810417†L150-L180】.

### Building your budget

1. **Determine your net income.**  Include salaries, freelance earnings and any other sources.
2. **List fixed expenses.**  These include rent, utilities, loan payments and tuition fees.
3. **List variable expenses.**  Groceries, transportation, entertainment and discretionary spending fall into this category.
4. **Set savings goals.**  Aim to save at least 20 % of your income by building an emergency fund and contributing to long‑term investments【699025171810417†L506-L523】.
5. **Adjust.**  If expenses exceed income, identify areas where you can cut back or increase earnings.

### Practice: Use the budgeting calculator
