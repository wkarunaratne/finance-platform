# Personal Finance Education Platform

This repository contains the initial files for a personal finance education platform focused on helping users allocate their income between consumption and investment.  The platform includes:

- **index.html:** A landing page introducing the platform and featuring a budgeting calculator.
- **style.css:** Styling for the website.
- **budget.js:** A simple JavaScript function for the budgeting calculator.
- **module1.md:** Draft content for the first learning module on budgeting and consumption basics.
- **personal_finance_platform_plan.md:** A project plan outlining the vision, modules, features and roadmap for the platform.

To get started, open `index.html` in a web browser to view the landing page.  The content will be expanded with additional modules, interactive tools and features as development progresses.
